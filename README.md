<h>Trying to define year-round weather regimes over EurAtl area in order to enhance wind outage previbility.</h2>

Context:

Wind energy is a low pilotability power source because it depends on wind speed to be efficient, wich is very variable. To prevent power outage, there is a need for mid/long term wind prevision.
Here, we try to link wind outage with usual (or canonical) synoptic situations that cause it. These 'usual synoptic situations' could be summed up using weather regimes, but it raises the need for defining it for transition seasons too, and especially since wind outages seem to be more frequent during these seasons.
But since their creation, weather regimes are only defined for specific seasons (winter/summer). Recent papers present new methods taht allow the definition of year-round weather regime (7 regimes). We will explore these methods.
